This is a proxy for OpenAI API. This allows you to distribute applications that leverage OpenAI while hiding your API key.

## How to get started

Choose a cloud hosting provider: Some popular options for free-tier cloud hosting include Heroku, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and AWS Free Tier. For simplicity, we'll use Heroku in this example.

Set up an account: Sign up for an account on Heroku (https://www.heroku.com/) if you don't have one already.

Install the Heroku CLI: Download and install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, which allows you to interact with Heroku from the command line.

Create a new Heroku app: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command to create a new Heroku app:

`heroku create`<br />
`git add .`<br />
`git commit -m "Initial commit"`<br />
`git push heroku master`<br />
